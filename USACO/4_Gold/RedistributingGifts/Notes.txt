Observations:
    - The "1" set of cows and "0" set of cows can be calc separately
    - The number of gifts have to assign in set mask and set mask^(1<<idx) where (idx not in mask) is mask union i (only differs by 1 gift)

let:
    - msb_mask = most significant bit in mask
    - smask = mask^(1<<i) with i in mask (useful for transition below)

dp[x][mask] = Number of ways to create a valid gift assignment for cows in mask using gifts in (mask \

dp[x][mask] = Sum <i in mask> (
                    - dp[msb_smask][smask] if (i = msb_mask && adj[i][x]);
                    - dp[i][smask] if (i!=msb_smask & adj[i][x]);
                )
